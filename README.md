# ARTIC-EBOV

### Background

The ongoing outbreak of [Ebola virus in the Democratic Republic of Congo](http://www.who.int/emergencies/crises/cod/en/) has highlighted the need for rapid sequencing ability to help with source attribution and to aid epidemiological investigations (including environmental reservoirs).
